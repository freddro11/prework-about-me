      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello Class my name is Freddy Rosales as you can see from the header. I'm excited for the class and welcome the challenge that this course will bring. I'm a 20 year veteran of the USAF and am looking to start a new and exciting career as a web devloper.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Panama City, Panama.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to cook, workout, play sports, spend time with my family and go to the beach. It's hard to do that here in AZ so we make it to California as much as we can.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job, to be honest, would be a hip hop artist. I love to write and still do so to this day. Just for me and the love of doing it though. Second dream job would be a race car driver, I got a need for speed.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Vail, AZ just outside Tucson, AZ. GO CATS!!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always been fascinated with coding and web devlopment. I was always so busy with my military career to try and learn it, but recently my brother in law finished a simalar boot camp and through his experience I decided I would take a shot at it myself. I'm excited and looking foward to the challenge.</p>
